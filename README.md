# GEOG0125 Advanced Topics in Social and Geographic Data Science

Task 1 Statistical Modeling + Spatial Analysis: 1. Utilized a Bayesian framework-based multi-variable spatial conditional autoregressive model (CAR) to predict COVID-19 mortality risks in the unit of Local Authority level in England. 2. Incorporated health score indices and socio-economic data as input variables. 3. Demonstrated Relative Risk Ratios, Statistical Significance, and Exceedance Probabilities through geographic spatial visualization to identify units with potential risk escalation. 4. Offered policy recommendations to intervene in COVID-19 mortality risks. (Distinction) 

Task 2 Machine learning: 1. Utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict the spatial distribution of greenery within the urban landscape of Cambridge, UK. 2. This empirical investigation harnessed the power of the PyTorch deep learning framework, enabling the fine-tuning of hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance, ultimately achieving a commendable prediction accuracy of 80%. 3. The geographic spatial visualization based on the predicted results provides suggestions for improving the greening rate of the city. (Distinction)
